# CSharpTaskApp
I just made my first app, which is a task manager that lets a user create and view the user's tasks, as well as be able ot properly quit the application
Enjoy!

P.S. Idk why I named my "Main menu" method as "Interface", when "MainMenu" could have been more appropriate name for it... I apologize in advance.
